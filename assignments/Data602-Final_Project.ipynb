    "    - Before spending too much time for cleaning the dataset make sure that it's good for the problem you would like to solve. So first make plan and then invest time and effort.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    - If you don't have a compelling reason don't work with a small dataset (at least 1000 rows and 10 features.)\n",
