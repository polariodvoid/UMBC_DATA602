    "# Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project you will be putting be applying the skills you learned in the class so far. More specifically, you will be asked to train a classification or regression model on a dataset of your own choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Deadlines\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ask any dataset-related questions by COB (Close of Business) October 10th.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Submit the completed deliverables at the beginning of class on October 13th (Week-7) at 4:30 PM.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you finish your work you can submit them to this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/5pbg31vbExQSGgU57). Let me know if you have any problems with the submission __immediately__.\n",

    "# Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will be using a dataset of your own choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "- You can use API's, webscraping and available open data repositories to get your data. Some suggestions are: \n",
    "\n",
    "    - [UCI ML Repo](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)\n",
    "    \n",

    "    \n",
    "- When you choose your dataset please be aware of the following pitfalls:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Before spending too much time for cleaning the dataset make sure that it's good for the problem you would like to solve. So first make plan and then invest time and effort.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Stay aware from time series data. We didn't studied the techniques for handling time series data. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Make sure that you find a dataset that is not studied extensively online. For example: No Titanic, House Price, Iris, MNIST etc. datasets. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - If you don't have a compelling reason don't work with a small dataset (at least 500 rows and 5 features.)\n",

    "# Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "- For this project there will be three deliverables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A Github repo that contains your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A Jupyter Notebook (I will refer it as `technical notebook` or `report`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A presentation (No more than 10 slides) and its recording shared via YouTube (between 5-6 minutes.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Should include the following sections:\n",
    "    - Abstract\n",
    "    - Introduction\n",
    "    - Very specific and clear research questions\n",

    "- Are the ML techniques adequately discussed?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are the results presented adequately?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overall quality of slides and visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Whether slides contains too much text or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure you check the audio quality in your recording. Also adjust the font size, screen size so that slides can be easily readable from the recording.\n"
