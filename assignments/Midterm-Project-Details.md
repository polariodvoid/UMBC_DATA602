# Overview 

In this project you will be putting be applying the skills you learned in the class so far. More specifically, you will be asked to train a classification or regression model on a dataset of your own choice. 

# Deadlines

1. Ask any dataset-related questions by COB (Close of Business) October 10th.

2. Submit the completed deliverables at the beginning of class on October 13th (Week-7) at 4:30 PM.


# Submission

Once you finish your work you can submit them to this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/5pbg31vbExQSGgU57). Let me know if you have any problems with the submission __immediately__.

# Dataset

- You will be using a dataset of your own choice. 

- You can use API's, webscraping and available open data repositories to get your data. Some suggestions are: 

    - [UCI ML Repo](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
    
    - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
    
    - [Wikipedia - Kaggle ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_datasets_for_machine-learning_research)
    
    - [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)
    
    - [Yelp API](https://www.yelp.com/fusion)
    
- When you choose your dataset please be aware of the following pitfalls:

    - Before spending too much time for cleaning the dataset make sure that it's good for the problem you would like to solve. So first make plan and then invest time and effort.
    
    - Stay aware from time series data. We didn't studied the techniques for handling time series data. 
    
    - Make sure that you find a dataset that is not studied extensively online. For example: No Titanic, House Price, Iris, MNIST etc. datasets. 
    
    - If you don't have a compelling reason don't work with a small dataset (at least 500 rows and 5 features.)
    
# Deliverables

- For this project there will be three deliverables:

1. A Github repo that contains your project.

2. A Jupyter Notebook (I will refer it as `technical notebook` or `report`).

3. A presentation (No more than 10 slides) and its recording shared via Youtube (between 5-6 minutes.)


## Github Guidelines

- Put an attention grabbing title to the repo.

- Github should include a license. 

- ReadMe should be included. 

- ReadMe should include these sections:
    - Overview
    - Goals
    - Motivation & Background
    - Data
    - Table of Content
    - Packages and Software
    
## Report Guidelines

This will a jupyter notebook and it will be uploaded to your github repo.

Should include the following sections:
    - Abstract
    - Introduction
    - Very specific and clear research questions
    - Brief EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)
    - Data cleaning
    - Feature engineering 
    - Modeling
    - Results and discussion
    - Conclusion and summary
    - Limitations and later work.
    - References and contributions

## Presentation Guidelines

This should be very brief presentation (10 slides) and targeted to your fellow colleagues in the class. 

I will be considering the following aspects of your presentation as I'm grading it:

- Is the motivation for the project explained in a compelling way?

- Figures are all legible, relevant and explained clearly.

- Are the ML techniques adequately discussed?

- Are the results presented adequately?

- Overall quality of slides and visualizations

- Whether slides contains too much text or not.

- Make sure you check the audio quality in your recording. Also adjust the font size, screen size so that slides can be easily readable from the recording.
