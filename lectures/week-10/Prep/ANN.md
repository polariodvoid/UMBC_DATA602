# Week-10 Artificial Neural Networks

Note that: ANN's are relatively more complicated than the material we have been covering so far. So this reading might be more challenging than others. If you feel that you are having difficulty to follow the text don't feel encouraged.


For a friendly start: Andrew Ng.

Read chapter-12: Implementing a Multilayer Artificial Neural Network from Scratch

__Single-layer neural network recap:__ (until p393 Classifying Handwritten Digits)

- Make sure you understand the role of Activation function, weights, learning rate in the simple setting. 

- What does fully connected network mean?

- What is input layer, what is output layer and what is hidden layers?

- Do you understand the process of __forward propagation__? (Note you don't have to understand all the mathematical details. If you understand why we need them and what they do it is enough.)

__Training an artificial neural network__ (p412 - p423)

- Understand backpropagation.(Note you don't have to understand all the mathematical details. If you understand why we need them and what they do it is enough.)

- why do we discuss the convergence problem here? Convergence of what?
