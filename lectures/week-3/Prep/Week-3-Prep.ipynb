    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand what is slope and intercept in simple linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the coefficient parameters?\n",
    "\n",
    "- What _the least squares_ method measures?\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is $e_i$ standing for in the context of 'advertising' dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "- __You can skip the derivations of $\\beta_{1}, \\beta_{2}$ in your first read__\n",
    "\n",
    "- __You don't need to memorize their formula!__\n",
    "\n",
    "- How would you explain the notion of biased and unbiased estimators?\n",
    "\n",
    "- __You can skip pages 66, 67__\n",
    "\n",
    "- How do you interpret $R^{2}$ statistics?\n",
    "\n",
    "- How do you go from simple linear regression and multiple linear regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can you explain why \"newspaper\" variable was \"significant\" in the simple linear regression model but not in the multiple linear regression model?\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the some tools that helps us to choose between different models?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explain Forward Selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is interaction effect?\n",
    "\n",

    "## The first homework details\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the first homework is due to week-4 lecture (09/22).Your task will be applying a linear regression model to a dataset of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Directions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You cannot work with datasets that is explored in our textbooks or in our classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Dataset should contain more than 200 observations (rows) and more than 4 columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data can be relatively clean but you should be doing the preprocessing procedures on your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As it is explained in Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow (2nd edition) chapter-2, you should be able to explain the business goal of your project very clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you are applying a transformation to some of your features you should explain the rationale of such decisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "- You should use visualization techniques to explore the data and to support your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You should be able to assess the model fitness and you should do model diagnosis as it is described in ISLR 3.3.3.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables:\n",
    "\n",
    "As I mentioned in the first class, I want you to upload your project into Github and share it with me the github link. Github folder should contain three main ingredient:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ReadMe \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Code + Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Summary + Report.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will explain more on what I will be looking for in each of these items later in the class. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a good example of a very good project done by one of my previous students: [Alphonso Woodbury - Project](https://github.com/a-woodbury/A-House-with-a-View)"
